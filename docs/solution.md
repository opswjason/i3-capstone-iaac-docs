# Our Solution

The proposed architecture leverages a blend of AWS services and DevOps tools to ensure an efficient, scalable, and robust environment for the weather application. This setup not only supports continuous integration and deployment but also enhances monitoring and logging, ensuring high availability and performance. Below is an in-depth look into each component and how they interconnect to deliver a seamless operational environment.

## Architecture Overview

The diagram outlines the AWS infrastructure setup for a weather application, utilizing various AWS services and DevOps tools. 

*Here's the breakdown*

### **Source Code Management and CI/CD Pipeline**
- **GitHub:** Stores the source code for the weather application.

- **Jenkins:** Handles continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). It triggers deployments and runs tests.

- **Ansible:** Used for configuration management and automation, deploying and configuring the application on different environments.

### **AWS CodeBuild and AWS CloudFormation**
- **AWS CodeBuild:** Builds and tests the application, triggered by AWS CloudFormation.

- **AWS CloudFormation:** Provisions and manages AWS resources using our custom templates, triggering deployments to AWS CodeBuild.

### **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
- **EKS Clusters:** Deployed in us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions as both were the only [supported regions](https://kodekloud.com/playgrounds/playground-aws#:~:text=the%20highlighted%20text.-,Supported%20Regions%3A,-us%2Deast%2D1) in  KodeKloud Playground.

- **VPC:** Clusters are within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation and security.

- **Pods:** The weather application runs inside Kubernetes pods on these EKS clusters.

### **Amazon S3**
- **Regions:** S3 buckets in us-east-1 and us-west-2 for storing application data and backups.

- **Backup and Restore:** Data backed up from us-east-1 to us-west-2 using [Velero for backup and restore](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/backup-and-restore-your-amazon-eks-cluster-resources-using-velero/) operations.

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Prometheus:** Monitors the application and collects metrics.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **Splunk:** Logs and analyzes application logs.

**This comprehensive setup ensures efficient deployment, management, and monitoring of the weather application using AWS and popular DevOps tools.**
